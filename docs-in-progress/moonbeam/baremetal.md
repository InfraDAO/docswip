### Run a tracing node

{% hint style="success" %}
Geth's `debug` and `txpool` APIs and OpenEthereum's `trace` module provide non-standard RPC methods for getting a deeper insight into transaction processing. As part of Moonbeam's goal of providing a seamless Ethereum experience for developers, there is support for some of these non-standard RPC methods. Supporting these RPC methods is an important milestone because many projects, such as [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/), rely on them to index blockchain data



To use the supported RPC methods, you need to run a **tracing node.** This guide covers the steps on how to setup and sync a tracing node on Moonbeam.

## Pre-Requisites

```bash
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y

sudo apt install -y git make wget gcc pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev jq gcc g++ curl libssl-dev screen apache2-utils build-essential pkg-config
```

### Setting up Firewall

Set explicit default UFW rules

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

Allow SSH

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
```
